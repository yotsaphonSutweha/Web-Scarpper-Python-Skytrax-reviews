"""the service was shocking""",5,Stephen Mitchell,"✅ Trip Verified |  Tokyo Narita to Bangkok. I don’t know whether the biz class cabin on an A380 is too big but the service was shocking. Not a single towel served to me was warm. They seem to bring out the starters in a random order and with no drinks trolley I was left sitting with the starter and no drink to match. If you decide to wait for a drink it means that they’ve already put your main on so in my case it was served cold. The cheese was nice but served with oranges, melons and grapefruit but no grapes. There was port on the trolley but they weren’t inclined to open it until I asked and then served it in a thimble. The cabin lights were turned down even though it was a 5.30pm departure arriving at 10pm.",A380,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to Bangkok,October 2019,no,3,1,2,2,1,0,1

"""made a mistake in our booking""",1,Laurent Verbeeck,"✅ Trip Verified |  We made a mistake in our booking of the return flight in November 2019 and immediately noticed this. Due to the departure just after midnight, we clicked the wrong date: one day too early. We contacted customer support immediately to report this and to get this solved. 2 days later, many phone calls and emails later to both Brussels and Bangkok, no decent alternative is offered. We get the message that our ticket was a promotion ticket (we never noticed this) and that no seats are available in other flight. When we check the correct flight, we still find seats available. Then they come with the excuse that it's not the same class. We are not talking about difference between business or economy. Apparently, Thai Airways also divide the economy in different classes with each letter of the alphabet. When we look closer, we see that every day the tickets are divided in different classes which makes it impossible to switch to another day in same class. Instead of helping us for the mistake, customer support keeps hiding behind the 'there are no tickets in same class' or proposes very high cost for cancellation of half the ticket price per person. Even when we are offering to pay the difference in price or a reasonable fee, the answer stays that they can't help us. As every day has different classes, Thai Airways makes it impossible to switch.

"""couldn't have been more disappointing""",3,Fitim Cami,"✅ Trip Verified | I was overwhelmed by flying the new Airbus A350 and even more for the food, since Thai food is my favourite cuisine. My experience with Thai Airways couldn't have been more disappointing (food-wise) on both 'to and from' flights. My flight had a layover in Bangkok, which means I took 4 planes and 4 meals in total. The food was so awful, no taste at all! The chicken tasted like plastic, the curry was horrible, as were the vegetables. The food was so bad, I refused 2 meals on my 12hr flight from Bangkok to Brussels! The cabin crew came only twice to serve water on the 12hrs flight. With the very dry air blowing from the A/C, this was very shocking. Inflight entertainment is very poor. The choice is very restricted. The Airbus A350 was pretty uncomfortable. The seats have almost no knee room. I'm 183cm. You have to be very lucky that the passenger up front doesn't recline his seat, or else, you're pretty screwed.

"""Tired looking crew""",1,B Sawyer,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Auckland. From check-in to leaving the plane we were not impressed. Tired looking crew that certainly do not know what a smile even is. Crew could not serve dinner quick enough - almost felt like it was thrown at us. Ran out of salty snacks prior to this, and crew member said he would come back with more, but never did so many did not even get this. Breakfast was inedible - both myself and my husband didn't eat our bland white looking breakfast. No drinks served through night on 10.5 hour flight. Movie choice terrible and connectivity no better. Did not perform important pre-landing check, a lady opposite us had her laptop out throughout landing and they did not check seat belts or anything. This is pretty basic and essential.

"""Thai Smile is the better product""",4,R Narandan,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vientiane to Bangkok on Thai Airways evening departure. The flight this evening was operated by HS-TER, a nine year old Airbus A330 named U Thong. As usual I had filled in my API information and checked in online. On arrival at VTE, I headed straight for the Internet check-in counter. Ground staff were on hand directing passengers. There was already a line up. However when we approached the head of the line, a senior ground service staff directed us to the Royal Silk check-in counter and processed us quite efficiently. She was warm and friendly. Security check and immigration wasn't too long (perks of a small airport) and we were at the gate with about an hour and a half to spare. At about 7:40 PM we were advised that the incoming aircraft was delayed out of BKK, due to which departure was delayed by 20 minutes, making the new departure time 8:50 PM. Boarding at 08:40 PM was chaotic with no designated order or series as is the norm with wide-body aircraft. Mind you, there was an announcement of boarding by row numbers, but the staff at the gate didn't seem to be too bothered. There was a dedicated line for loyalty program elite tiers and business class passengers. The welcome on board was friendly, but hardly the warmth one associates with Thai Airways. The seat was the standard economy on A330, equipped with a personal television. On this short haul sector the in-flight entertainment was deactivated and the only display was the rather outdated flight map. The seat pocket contained a copy of Sawasdee, Vision (the in-flight entertainment listing), duty free shopping guide and a promotional document from the Thai government. The flight was delayed further and we finally took off 36 minutes late. The service on board was lacklustre. The crew were neither friendly nor warm. The quality of cuisine served was unimpressive. Naturally, I compared it to the Thai Smile aircraft that I took for the inward bound flight and the food was below average. The meal on offer was a cheesy mushroom calzone with too much of the pastry accompanied by a rather shoddy choux cream custard and a bottle of water. This was followed by the crew making a trip down the aisle with orange juice and tea/coffee. They played the Thai Immigration video which mandated that one must complete the TM6 form provided by the airline. Needless to say, the crew waited until the last minute to start distributing these even though we were on the tarmac in VTE for quite some time. Eventually after they handed out the form, the crew member approached me to stow my tray table for landing. I couldn't help but respond with, ""If you wanted to secure the cabin, you might have handed these out a bit earlier."" I am  of the opinion that Thai Smile is the better product on this route.",A330,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Vientiane to Bangkok,August 2019,yes,4,2,1,0,4,0,3
"""publicly refused in a rude haughty diminishing way""",4,G Dupont,"✅ Trip Verified | On June 23th 2019 I took flight TG 934 from Bangkok Suvarnabhumi to Brussels having a full flex ticket. When the staff brought the aperitive we didnt receive any salty snack. At lunchtime the air hostess asked what I would like to drink. I answered that I would like a glass of white wine with the starter and a glass of red wine with the main dish so she wouldn't have to pass by 2 times. It was publicly refused in a rude haughty diminishing way, replying that that I could only have one drink at the time. Thai Airways appear to have overstaffed, overaged unmotivated workers, nepotism, lack off busines vision, poor marketing stategy, poor financial managment.

"""I couldn’t ask for any more""",10,R West,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kansai to Melbourne via Bangkok. The aircraft on the first sector (Osaka - Bangkok) was switched on the day of travel from an A380 to a B773ER. Despite the change to a smaller aircraft I was still given my seating preference and there was zero problem with my special meal. Seat pitch on both aircraft (773 to Bangkok and A350) to Melbourne was as good as economy seating gets nowadays, and thankfully the seating on the 773 was 9 across and not the 10 across many airlines have installed. Safety checks were made before departure and landing, and there were announcements before any turbulence, which turned out to be mild. Service on both sectors was exemplary, the crew were smiling and helpful through out despite both flights being nearly full. People have criticised the IFE for lack of choice, but in its favour I’ve found it to be reliable, and I generally find plenty to enjoy in the world music and world movies sections. A meal and a snack were served on the shorter (five hour) flight to Bangkok, and supper and breakfast were served on the flight to Australia. The food was of a reasonable standard, there was a full drinks service before lunch and dinner and in addition there were nice little touches, like the crew offering extra croissants at breakfast. On the overnight flight to Australia I was able to sleep but was aware of several water/juice runs during the night. On both flights, especially towards the end of the longer Melbourne flight, the crew were focussed on keeping the washrooms clean and serviceable.

How Lufthansa warrants 5 stars whilst TG gets 4 and UA a measly 3 is beyond me. The service, seating and menus on Thai are much better than both airlines and they offer individual pods on the A350, whereas LH and UA still have the older style seating where one has to climb over their neighbour to reach the aisle.

This was because of the incoming flight did not leave Bangkok. We were able to check-in and have our bags tagged anyway.

The flight was uneventful and the service on board was very good.  But after clearing immigrations in Bangkok, we could not find our luggage. So we went to Lost & Found to announce it. They could not tell us what happened and where is the luggage. Anyway, we gave them our contact details and went to our hotel. About one day later they called us and brought the luggage to the hotel. After all this trouble we decided to make a claim under the EU regulation for the delayed arrival. The communication with them had to happen in writing using letters. So the entire process was long and even though they had all our data in their systems, they still requested extra documents to be submitted.

"""They did the right thing""",10,Aiyaphol Kemapuckpong,"✅ Trip Verified | Nagoya to Bangkok. I feel that the way an airline could be judged well is the way they handle a situation which is out of their control. Typhoon Jebi had struck Osaka three days into a five day holiday, which left Osaka Kansai airport flooded and all flights there were cancelled. We were scheduled to leave Osaka on the 6th of September. The night before, I asked my parents to call Thai Airways (as they were in Bangkok) at an odd hour, and the agent on the phone re-booked us through Nagoya without any additional charge. We did, however, have to pay for the high-speed rail tickets for the journey to Nagoya. Thai Airways had also upsized the aircraft from a Boeing 787-8 to a Boeing 777-300 High-Density configuration. This meant that we did not get the brand new B787, but we understood the situation. Despite being rebooked on that flight last-minute, at check in we were given exit row seats, and we even had an empty seat between us. Due to a meeting my friend was supposed to attend the day after we were originally supposed to arrive, we chose a very odd flight time. Leaving at Half past midnight and arriving at half past four am in the morning. Nagoya Airport is extremely desolate at this time of night, and no duty-free chocolates were being sold, a huge disappointment as that is a must whenever leaving Japan. The flight was boarded extremely quickly, even though the plane was almost full, and we took off 30 minutes before the scheduled departure time. After takeoff, the crew literally ran through the cabin with cold sandwiches and drinks. I did not mind this at all. The service was rushed so everyone could get some much-needed sleep. I fell asleep shortly after and then was woken up by the crew wheeling the breakfast cart near my seat. I noticed they just looked around and served passengers when they woke up. I saw that everyone was definitely fed. The seat on this 19-year-old Boeing 777-300 was comfortable, an old plush seat that was slightly worn, but still had TVs at every seat but I can't comment on legroom as I had an exit row. If you're flying the newer B777-300ER, there is no bulging slide at the exit doors, but this older plane still had a slide. I did not mind it. We arrived an entire hour early, at which point Suvarnabhumi airport is as deserted as can be. In the end, this was a crisis made a lot better. They did the right thing as this was an act of god yet they still took as much responsibility as they could. The only thing I am slightly disappointed about was the fact that we weren't compensated for the high-speed rail tickets.

Also the flight attendants were generous with free drinks including alcohol plus the snack boxes at each galley provided a pleasant touch.

"""flight got off to a bad start""",3,John Duffus,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. This flight got off to a bad start. Not having flown TG business class for almost a decade, I got out of my taxi at Gate 1 on the east side of the terminal as advised by the airport sign. Searching for business class bag drop, I could only see domestic counters. I noticed a signboard saying international was actually at counters H/J. Once I got there, another sign said only economy, not business. So back I trooped to discover biz class is rather hidden to the left of the domestic counters! Bag drop, security and fast track Immigration were speedy, but with the departure gate being at the opposite west end of the airport, there was then the ghastly long hike through one massively long shopping mall with no people movers to make it easier.  The TG lounge had no croissants, sandwiches with only white bread and a sickly sweet ersatz orange juice. At least the espresso was enjoyable. Boarding at Gate E1 is a bus gate. Although the bus I took was clearly marked “Business and First Class Passengers”, I later discovered only two other biz passengers were on it. All the seats and most of the standing room were taken by economy passengers. There then followed a 10-minute bus ride back all the way along the airport and round to the domestic section which was exactly where I had started before the hike. Why it is not possible for passengers to board from a gate on the East side seems incomprehensible and just makes flying TG short haul so frustrating. After hauling bags up ramp steps I finally made it on board. Service on the A330 was attentive, but having chosen the western lunch, the salmon, although it looked nice enough, was utterly tasteless. I have had more tasty meals in economy on some other Asian carriers. My other issue with is the appalling IFE listing. No explanation or timings for the video offerings. The music listing is bizarre. Want some classical music? How about something by Schumann? Well that listing is “Robert Schumann” as the composer and then “Robert Schumann” again as the work. No detail of what Schumann work one might hear. The flight departed and arrived on time. On the return trip, the aircraft was parked at a bus gate. Half way to the terminal, the bus stopped allegedly to let an aircraft pass. Only there was no aircraft. So we stood there packed like sardines for more than 5 minutes for no reason.

"""got the sought-after two seaters""",9,J Garlin,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Denpasar via Bangkok. It's only when you travel long distances in Economy in spacious aeroplanes like the A380 and Boeing 747-400 that I realise how poky and cramped the A350/787 is. The LHR-BKK sectors were in the A380 and we secured window seats on the top deck (well worth the slight price premium). BKK to DPS was in the Boeing 747, and we got the sought-after two seaters near the back of the plane. Seats were pretty comfy in all cases with acres of space, and the provision of food and drink was quite generous in all sectors. All flights were on time and boarding/exiting was efficient. I see the other LHR-BKK flight is in a 777, and it cannot be long before THAI retire the 744's, so the days of doing Europe to Bali in such style are no doubt numbered, so my advice is to choose Thai and do it while you still can.",A380 / Boeing 747-400,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Denpasar via Bangkok,June 2019,yes,4,4,4,3,4,0,4
"""The seat is good""",9,L patraporn,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Osaka . There was an aircraft change from an A350 to a B777-300ER, so I was slightly disappointed. Check in at 4:45 am meant only one star gold counter was open, and a line soon formed. The royal silk lounge at concourse E was adequate but felt slightly crammed. Priority boarding was honoured and I chose an exit row for this flight, however there was no window! Avoid row 40 on the 777. The seat is good, although it is a slimline design the padding is very supportive and there is even an option to adjust the lumbar support. After takeoff, meals were served, and on flights to Japan, the Japanese breakfast is much preferable to the omelette and sausage option. Before landing a chinese takeaway box style snack is served. Inside was some rice with stir-fried chicken on top. This is much more creative than a hot sandwich or wrap! Entertainment in the month of April was not the best, however I think this has changed from month to month. Arrival at Kansai Airport is efficient and fast, we were on a train to Osaka within 15 minutes, including picking up our luggage. Our return flight was slightly disappointing. Normally we always choose the upper deck on the A380, but there weren't any window seats left, so we chose the bulkhead row on the lower deck. Check in was quite a disaster. We stood behind a long queue, puzzled if it's the business class queue or the economy class queue. The staff quickly came and gave us an answer, but within 10 minutes we were attended to at the check in desk.

The price of a paid ticket on this route was about $700, and I paid 27,500 miles plus $100 in taxes. I specifically chose flights which were on their long-haul aircraft. The check in was fast, and with their gold members, Thai ask if we are satisfied with our seat selection or would prefer otherwise. Lounge located after check in not the best, but certainly not the worst. It filled up gradually. There is a 30 minute complimentary foot or back massage for business class customers. This flight was full in business. I had seat 15K which was staggered away from the aisle. I received a warm welcome by name and was asked what I would like to drink. I settled with a mimosa, and their champagne (Vevue Cliquot) has become my favourite. The service on this flight was prompt. Meal choices on the outbound were 3 chicken dishes, Thai, Western or Chinese style. I chose the Thai style which was fried rice with chicken and chinese sausage. A very authentic Thai breakfast, but the choice puzzles me. I had preordered my inbound meal, and it was a beef tenderloin steak with grilled veg and potatoes, and the beef was very tender. The seat has got to be one of the best business class seats I have experienced. It is comfortable, with a 180 degree recline, foot room is large, and there are  storage areas around the seats. One thing to be improved is that the fabric is worn out and is due for replacement. The cabin crew on these flights are some of the most warm crew I've ever met. Everything was bought out on a tray and placed at your seat. I had some really nice conversations. It  is true Thai hospitality. Entertainment is good, but Thai don't have the widest selection.

The cabin was so hot when we were boarding people were fanning themselves with anything they could find. It didn't get better after take off. I had words with a staff member and she did eventually get the temperature a lot cooler. Then hours into the journey the plane became a fridge. I would have thought technology on a modern aircraft could keep the temperature at a reasonable level. Also on this aircraft there are no personal air vents so you are reliant on the crew knowing what they are doing. When the seat in front fully reclines there is very little room. You have to recline your own seat to focus on the TV screen. Food is absolutely terrible on Thai. 90% of the passengers are European. Rice, Thai chicken sausages and a fried egg slapped on top might be fine for Thai customers  but everyone I could see barely touched their food. Thai must throw away so much food in one flight - the only food myself and my family enjoyed was a Kit Kat in my son's goody box that Thai gave him. Cabin crew haven't improved over the years.

There was a delay of an hour at the gate which was not managed efficiently. In the flight there was no wifi working and no interactive flight maps so it was frustrating not to know the details of your flight, and a total lack of information being relayed by the captain and not a word of apology for the delay or the reason.

However, during the next three hours of the flight I didn’t see a single cabin crew to offer drinks to passengers. When I went to the galley to ask for some water and ask why not a single round of service was offered, the crew’s reply was that they were getting ready to serve breakfast.

I could have sworn these were the doing ghosts. The food was similar to a budget airline. Basically both the condition of the aircraft and the service was disappointing.

They boarded economy class passengers through the front door making it difficult to to serve pre-flight drinks and when they did you felt like you were in a goldfish bowl being gawked at as the passengers waited to move through. 50 minutes late in departing and no explanation! Inflight my wife in 14a dropped her seat back to relax and opened up a big gap which could not be moved so she had to be moved to a spare. The supper was unbelievable with the offer potato chips and 2 little bread rolls with something inside. They said full service breakfast, so when it came just a tray with everything lashed on (a small bowl with three bread items stacked - no service) and each of 4 flights we had you were served cereal in a glass, very poor for business class. When discussing these issues with the Purser it was everyone else’s fault. When we left Australia we were on a late night flight which was cancelled, I think I know why.

We also ended up with nearly an 8 hour wait at Bangkok instead of just over 3 hours. That said we found the Thai Airways experience good. Staff friendly and nothing too much trouble.

As soon as we stepped into the Royal Silk cabin it was as though the weight of the world was lifted from our shoulders and we could begin our holiday in Thailand. The staff were fantastic and genuinely there to make you flight as pleasant as possible. The Virgin staff were ok but essentially it was all about them, the Thai Airways staff were there to look after you. The cabin staff on the return leg Bangkok to Hong Kong on Jan 5th in particular were quite superb and deserve special mention. The cabin feels spacious with aisle access for all seats and is arranged in a 1-2-1 pattern. Alternate window seats have slightly better window access and are set slightly in from the aisle. The seat converts to a full flat bed but we didn't put it to the test on such a short flight. The meal BKK to HKG was a lamb massaman and actually very edible, a selection of cheeses, additional crackers were gladly provided upon asking. A couple of deserts were offered and they insisted we try both as the flight was not full so there was enough to go round. Check in at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport was relaxed and courteous with a dedicated Royal Silk international drop off zone. There were even seats for you during the check in process. Didn't particularly use the in flight entertainment system, the rest of the family managed to squeeze in a film.

Not even ask the passengers about their choice of meal and directly give passengers whatever the meal they are holding. Crew were not seen serving drinks during the mid of the flight. No warm towel prior to take off and landing. Inflight entertainment was passable. Seat is comfort. Third sector was from Osaka to Bangkok. Some crew were very rude. Rushing for the meal and expecting the passengers to finish it quickly. Even heard a enior crew raised her voice to at least three passengers, ""Finish? Bring this go there (finger point to the back galley) I won't come back again, understand!"" The flight was six-hour long and why don't give some time for the passengers to enjoy their meals slowly. No beverage serving / crew going round the cabin with drinks in the mid of the flight. Crew takes long time to answer call bell. The same goes to the last sector. Rushing to do their service and very impatient. Few times I observed the crew can't wait to push away the cart perhaps the passengers were still thinking of what the crew were saying or couldn't listen to it clearly.

Presently Thai have a Boeing 747-400 plying the route, so it's clearly a far from new aircraft. That manifests itself in pretty basic in-flight entertainment options where picture and sound quality is a bit iffy. However for a flight of 3 hours 45 minutes, not only is business class offered, but on the aircraft on which I flew, first-class seats were sold as business class. Oodles of space (fully flat bed if you wanted it), and typically gracious and attentive Thai cabin crew.

"""everyone got a row to themselves""",10,Aiyaphol Kemapuckpong,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangkok. I haven’t been so satisfied with my experience for quite a while in economy. I recently got my gold card upgrade. Check in was very quick and attentive. I decided to use the Lufthansa lounge, and it was surprisingly well polished! Since I got my card upgrade I used their senator lounge which is better. Boarding was quick, only about 200 people on a 507 seat airplane! I booked the upper deck economy as always. As soon as “Boarding Complete” was announced on the PA, there were 13 people in a 58 seat cabin. That meant that everyone got either a row to themselves or an extra legroom seat. I chose the former, but couldn’t sleep. Oddly enough, nobody in that cabin got any sleep on an overnight flight. The crew on this flight were astounding. As there were only 13 pax, they went around taking meal orders during boarding, and instead of wheeling the cart to our seats, she just parked the cart near the exit and gave us our trays. I also particularly liked this crew member as she had a relaxing tone whenever she spoke. She was also one of the more senior crew so that made for a great flight. I have a habit of asking for seafood meals even though I’m not pescatarian, but what really annoyed me on this flight was the fact that I was served two bowls of chopped fruit as a side dish for my breakfast, and an identical bowl for dessert for dinner. After telling the crew this, they gave me a pumpkin spice pudding and vanilla ice cream from business class. One thing that is annoying (and most airlines have this issue) is the location of the shared power sockets. They’re right behind someone else’s calf half the time, or your calf. I would definitely prefer them to be in between the seats as there is no awkwardness in trying to get your phone charged. Thai’s seats on the A380 are one of the most comfortable economy seats out there in my opinion. Legroom is fine, and there is a large footrest that is highly appreciated on long flights. But the most comfortable economy seat goes to their 747. Massive 34’ pitch and a very wide seat as well. Too bad these aircraft are being phased out. Upon arrival, My baggage was one of the first fifty bags to come out, and baggage delivery speed wasn’t too bad. To conclude, I have had many happy flights with Thai, and have clearly gained trust with them. Their flights are seldom delayed except for late departures due to short turnaround times. But they still arrive on time! Speaking of which, on my outbound from Bangkok, they said that the delay was due to “late arrival of inbound aircraft” when clearly the plane arrived on schedule from Paris.",A380,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London to Bangkok,December 2018,yes,5,5,5,5,5,1,5

"""seats felt so uncomfortable""",1,W Galley,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Paris via Bangkok. Checking in at Sydney they had one person only serving economy passengers. Seeing there would be 250+ economy passengers it certainly took awhile to get to the front of the line. They did eventually have 3 staff as I got closer to the front of the que, but they sure took there time getting through the economy passengers. Getting on the plane was great they boarded from back to front, the only high light on my journey. We leave the gate and get to the end of the runway to hear an announcement from the captain that we are returning to the gate as there is a tech issue. He tells us it should take 20mins, it takes an hour.  The service on board was very average. Very slow and when the meal cart came along I asked for beef as I didn't want the chicken to be told there is no option. Again, I understand and take the chicken. It was so hot with spices and curry I didn't finish it. The rest of the flight was just ok. Rarely saw the flight attendants. Very average IFE. I had a blanket on me and staff didn't check and see it I had my belt on. Also on both flights the cabin was so humid. I have never been on such a hot aircraft before. That's for both the 747 and A380. There are no air vents on either aircraft. The seats felt so uncomfortable that your backside hurts. When we arrived at Bangkok we didn't go to a terminal and had to climb down stairs in the rain and get on buses to transfer to terminal.  All in all I would not choose Thai again. From there lack of cabin service to a flight delay (on the way home they changed us to another 747 in Bangkok as the first one was grounded due to another tech issue and we fly home on the 747 we arrived on with the tech issue in Sydney, we had to again climb up stairs, thankfully no rain this time).",Boeing 747-400 / A380,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Paris via Bangkok,May 2018,no,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

"""Updates were minimal""",3,Simon Cuerden,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lahore to Hanoi via Bangkok in May 2018. After having checked in for my flight from Lahore to Bangkok, I was waiting at the gate for the departure. Shortly before the scheduled departure time of 11:40pm an announcement was made informing passengers that the flight departure time had been delayed until 1:30am. At this time no explanation was given as to why this was happening (or if it was it wasn’t communicated in English). After the announcement I spoke to a Thai ground staff member and she told me that the flight had been delayed due to bad weather and had been rerouted to Amritsar, India. I understand that adverse weather occurs from time to time and that all airlines are governed by strict rules regarding how many hours the pilot and cabin crew are allowed to fly. I was however angry and disappointed at how the situation was handled by ground staff. Updates in the form of passenger announcements were minimal. Instead passengers had to search for Thai representatives to find out what was going on. Information was inconsistent and misleading: the plane was delayed due to bad weather; we would be leaving soon; we would not be leaving soon; the plane was delayed due a technical issue; the plan was delayed due to administrative problems in Amritsar. The lack of accurate information just added to the feelings of uncertainty and confusion. The main Thai Airways representative dealing with the situation was out of his depth. At many times during the evening he was surrounded by a mob of angry and confused passengers desperate to know what was going on. The representative tried to maintain his composure but at times raised his voice, including at me, this was extremely unprofessional. The real problems began when the flight was eventually cancelled, and the airline begrudgingly arranged accommodation for the passengers. There was no clear procedure, and nobody knew what was going on. Thai Airways took a situation that was very stressful and made it even more so. There was no clear procedure. Instead staff were constantly on their mobile phones telling customers to “wait a few minutes.” This continued for a couple of hours. Ironically it was the passengers, not the Thai Airways staff, who were most supportive of each other. Everyone was so confused. It really was survival of the fittest. People didn’t know where to go, and some instances gave up altogether. This chaos could have been so easily curtailed in so many ways: information on the loudspeaker system; a point person to explain the procedure; staff holding signs.

Night flight so looking forward to some rest before my 07:00 arrival at Heathrow. Unfortunately a full flight. The row of 4 in front of me was occupied by a mother, father and two small children who thought it would be great to simulate a camping holiday by draping the supplied blankets across the tops of the seats and supplying their offspring with led torches which they persisted in shining throughout the night keeping all other passengers awake. They reclined all 4 seats meaning it was impossible to use the tray table for eating or viewing the screens. They ignored any polite request to create room for eating.

Compared to our outbound leg reviewed previously, the 1st sector on an aging Boeing 747  was a trip of a bygone era. It brought back memories on what is was like flying 40 years ago – with service to match! What a difference the cabin crew can make. Boarding in Munich was orderly. We were seated in row 68JK. After take-off , drinks were offered quickly followed by tasty  meals. The very personable Cabin Crew in our area of the aircraft continually made an appearance offering water and drinks. Nothing was too much of a problem. Seats were comfortable and with generous leg-room. There were about 80 seats vacant on this flight so my wife was able to stretch out and get some sleep. Special praise to a female cabin crew member and to male who I thought that their in-flight service was exemplary – and restored my faith in Thai Airways and wanting to travel with them again - after a less than favorable flight reviewed earlier. Flight departed on time, arrived early and was very smooth. We departed the aircraft feeling valued customers. The overnight sector TG 475 BKK/ SYD on a 747 and seated in a similar area was again a most pleasant flight where we had great views of the lights of some major cities, was able to get some sleep and the meals were sufficient and tasty.

Flight on B747 seated in bulkhead seats to BKK although nothing special – was a pleasant flight. Good legroom, edible food and attentive cabin crew. I remember that boarding in Sydney was a little ‘chaotic’. Flight TG 940 was on a A350-900 from BKK to MXP and was something I was looking forward to flying on for the 1st time. Can’t understand all the hype about this aircraft. I thought it was noisy (even compared to a aging 747), the seats in row 61 were decidedly uncomfortable offering very little under thigh support, I could feel the seat frame through the hard cushion, entertainment system not user friendly and problematic. Frankly, we were glad to get out of the seats in Milan. Thai meals tried to appease the Italians on board and were a dismal failure - not Thai food nor anything else. My Thai wife was in tears in not being able to eat the food on offer on her national airline. I was hungry during the night and went to the galley to ask for a snack - no snacks or fruit. Cabin crew less than impressive – I noted that before take-off - when instructed to arm doors and ‘cross check’ – that 2 of the crew I could see did not cross check. Cabin crew made themself scarce during the night – not coming around to give out water or juice. They never asked passengers anywhere that I could see - to put their seat back upright during meal times - necessitating us requesting those in front to do so . Seat belt sign on during turbulence but people still wandered off to the toilet without crew intervention.

"""highly recommend if cheap""",10,Aiyaphol Kemapuckpong,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Tokyo NRT. I chose Thai airways based on the aircraft type (a380) and price. I bought three tickets for my family, and we paid extra to sit in the upper deck. Check in was a complete nightmare, the queue at Bangkok airport spanned about 200 metres, luckily we already checked in online and the bag drop counter had a waiting time of only 10 min. Unfortunately the lady who attended to us was quite impolite and we had better experiences in the past. Boarding was an absolute nightmare, people just kept flowing in. Although we were the first of the economy passengers we didn’t get in quickly. The flight attendant at the main door is polite, and welcomes me onboard. I have to walk all the way to the back of the plane and then take the rear stairs. There is a huge amount of storage on the upper deck. You’ve got side bins, and the overhead bins aren’t like the 747 bins, they’re quite big. This flight to Tokyo was quite full, with the premium cabins having a 100% load factor. We took off, and service started with a cocktail snack and a drinks service. Strangely, on the upper deck, both aisles are served by the same cart, starting with the left side. Since it’s only 7 rows I didn’t mind. Breakfast was a choice of fish or omelette, I chose the fish and it was a very big portion of snapper accompanied by Japanese rice, which was very good. My seat mate didn’t finish her omelette entree, so it’s a hit or miss! The seat itself is comfortable, I had the front row so it was a comfortable flight. Entertainment wasn’t too good, choices are slightly lacking. WiFi is a rip off, as $34 for 100MB of data is way too expensive if you compare it to airlines like Finnair who charge less for the entire flight. An hour before landing, ice cream is distributed. We had one go around during landing, and after landing, I passed customs in a breeze, but the baggage claim wait was a nightmare. It took approximately 30 minutes for one bag. On the return trip, the bag drop looked so long, so we did something unusual: We went to the United counter and asked them to print boarding passes for us, And it worked! We did have to ditch a flip knife though, as we didn’t check any baggage. Boarding was really efficient as they sorted out the passengers by zone at the gate. This flight, I was surprised to know that the purser and three other flight attendants were from my previous outbound flight! Unfortunately, on this flight, I didn’t have a bulkhead seat, and it wasn’t as good as the first flight, but still okay, since I was on the upper deck. The food on this flight was pretty good, and service was similar to the outbound. The difference was that on this flight, there was a self serve drinks counter in the galley. On this flight, I decided to ask for some business class food, and they gave me two to try, and both were pretty delicious. They were also nice enough to plate the food like they would serve it to a business passenger! The landing in Bangkok was surprisingly loud as we may have landed on a groove. The captain of this flight was kind enough to be standing in front of the first class section and said goodbye to every passenger. This flight was very worth the money, as it was quite cheap, and I was able to book extra legroom seats free of charge.

"""Overall a pleasant surprise""",9,P Lamapon,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Brussels. I have always been reluctant to fly Thai Airways in Business for a number of reasons, but this time has proven to be something different. The business class cabin crew introduced themselves to us and greeted us by name. The service has also become more personalised in many ways from no longer putting food on the tray all the way to frequently (almost every half hour) attending passengers who were not sleeping during those times where most of the passengers were asleep. Apart from an immensely improved soft product, the seats on this particular equipment is new. The seat reclined into a full flatbed where you can really get a sleep. Thai now provides you with one pillow, one extra pillow for lumbar support and an extra padding for sleeping. The IFE was also very responsive and the inflight WiFi which all business passengers were given 10MB trial for free was also quite fast. Overall, a pleasant surprise, over my last Business Class trip with Thai Airways 1.5 years ago.

I am puzzled why Thai airways have a habit of changing the aircraft closer to the flight date. This time the plane was down-graded from an A380 to a 747-400.  We had the unpleasant experience with this rude  male chief flight attendant. Our seats were 23A-B so we left our hand-carry items in the overhead compartment that was labelled as that. Then rude attendant telling us that we should be putting our belongings in the next compartment instead. The funny thing is that this compartment was not even labelled and how will we know that this compartment was meant for us? Relocating our belongings was not an issue for us but the tone of this attendant was off putting.  I thought cabin crews are meant to assist passengers when needed?

Our flight was delayed due to bad weather, which of course can happen, but the 1 hour we waited for our plane to depart we were unable to access the entertainment. It didn't become available until about 30-40 minutes into the flight. None of the March entertainment that we'd seen advertised was available on our flight, and we were flying on the 17 March! We were disappointed to find no vegetarian meal available. We had not pre-ordered this, and there was no option to pre-order through the app. I have now tried reaching the airline through their live chat, but have received no replies to my request.

"""I recommend Thai's FC offering""",9,H Simpson,"✅ Trip Verified | Travelled from London/LHR to Bangkok in First Class. This was the first time using I've used Thai Airways for many years as I usually travel with Emirates. Firstly the good. As a first class passenger you get a choice of Star Alliance lounges at the airport including Uniteds flagship Global alliance lounge. This IMHO is by far the best lounge. Boarding was a breeze and the FAs welcome you on board with offerings of Champagne (Dom Perignon) and other soft drinks. Whilst not an enclosed cabin such as Emirates or Etihad the position of the seating means you do have some privacy from other passengers. Service on board was very good though mechanical. I did have to ask for vodka to go with the caviar. On the airlines stated previously the FA would ask if you wanted it. First world problems! There is no dine on demand either. The screen isn't as big as Emirates and seems further away but the entertainment package was fairly good and kept me occupied for most of the flight. On landing at BKK there is a buggy waiting to take you the to the Diplomatic fast track immigration counter, once through you are met again by ground staff who will then get your bag from the carousel for you. The service was exceptional and more akin to that of a VIP passenger The bad. Not a lot really. I found the bed not particularly comfortable but then I'm picky and the onboard service isn't as polished as Emirates but given that Thai was a lot cheaper its certainly one of the better FC airlines. One major issue is that you get very little free WIFI (10meg if I remember correctly) and then have to pay a Kings ransom for more data. In today's connected age and given the cost of the flight I would of expected this to be offered free of charge as other middle-eastern airlines do..

"""staff at CNX was in the wrong""",2,Mike Malek,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chiang Mai to Frankfurt via Bangkok. Our dog can be temperamental with strangers, so it was critical for us to bring her as excess baggage on our flight when we were relocating from Thailand to Portugal. When we booked our flights, the booking agent at the Thai Airways Corporate offices told us that a dog up to 40kg (animal and crate) would be $750 USD to transport her as excess baggage to Europe. The agent’s quote was consistent with the Thai Airways Pet Travel policy found on their website. We arrived at Chiang Mai International Airport on Christmas Day with Tam, and all of our belongings approximately 2½ hours before our flight. We provided the ticketing agent with the printed reservation confirmation (including all of the updates) that had been provided to us by the booking agent at the Corporate Offices. When we checked in, we had other issues regarding our baggage and associated fees but that is secondary to what followed. We loaded Tam (crate and all) onto the luggage scale and the total weight was 39.8 kg. Shortly thereafter, the ticketing agent told us that Tam could not travel with us on our flight because she was over 32kg. This was in direct contradiction to what the Thai Airways website says, as well as our reservation confirmation that we made in person at Thai Airways Corporate office in Chiang Mai. There we stood at the Thai Airways counter on Christmas day, after months of preparation, checking and double-checking that we had complied with all of the travel and export requirements, ensuring that the 40kg. weight limit was allowed and documented on our booking confirmation, in total disbelief. We spent 2 hours at the ticketing counter dealing with an agent who seemed entirely indifferent about the circumstances. The only explanation that she was able to provide was “Bangkok not accept”. We had to ask for a supervisor and eventually the highest person in charge for Thai Airways at the airport. After speaking with the Supervisor and being told once again that Tam could not fly with us, the Duty Manager eventually came down and told us that the booking agent in the Corporate Offices should not have made the reservation for our dog. On 2 January, I sent a lengthy email to three Directors at Thai Airways describing our experience. Several days later I received an email confirmation from Thai Airways Customer Relations Dept. that they received my email and would be conducting an investigation into our situation. On 10 January, I sent a follow-up email about our case. On 12 January I received an email from the Chief of the Customer Relations Svc. Dept. regarding the investigation that they completed on our case. In the Chief’s response, she acknowledged that Thai Airways Staff at CNX was in the wrong and should have accepted our dog on our flight, but she indicated that because we were given additional baggage allowance (as a gesture of goodwill) that there was nothing further Thai Airways would do for us. On  12 January another email was directed to Customer Relations, the Chief,  Directors and  VP's. In it I expressed that while we appreciated the gesture, including the additional bags was a soft cost to Thai Airways and that it surely did not compensate for their error. I also highlighted that bringing Tam on our flight as excess baggage was the single most important factor in selecting Thai Airways.

"""they certainly achieved the service""",5,C Sing,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Bangkok to Incheon via Hong Kong. Thai Airways is known for its service. I believe they certainly achieved the service. The cabin crew's service was beyond 'nice'. They were willing to help at any given time, and when I informed the crews that the restroom was a bit dirty, (because somebody decided to throw the toilet paper to the toilet and flush it) they rushed in to clean after saying 'thanks for informing us'. I really loved how they handled that issue without any frustration. Brilliant work ethics were shown there. The aircraft itself made me think like 'well, cabin crews deserve a better plane than this!'. Seat was very uncomfortable because of the metal box that was sitting under the seat in front of me - and my seat wasn't the only seat where I could see those fixed-metal boxes and I was (by the way, I'm not that tall, I'm only 1.78m) forced to spend the most of the flight with one leg stretched all the way, and another crammed in. Only positive I can think of is the fact that the seat formation was 3-3-3 instead of 3-4-3. However, the reason why I gave 1 star in seat comfort is because I would've given a 0 if this 777 was 3-4-3! That metal box is very annoying, so be sure to check your seat before you book your seat. IFE wasn't good. Not only were the contents missing, but display itself was a mess. My eyes started hurting after 2 minutes of movie watching, and I couldn't see anything from the movie properly. If I had an option to not have IFE and not have the prementioned iron box thing, I would probably choose not to have IFE. (It was that miserable). That's the reason why I gave a 1 in IFE. Food was good except for the fact that one option ran out. That's the mere reason why I gave four on that category. Well, I wouldn't recommend you to fly this airline if you have alternatives like Emirates, Singapore Airlines, etc if you're flying 777-300. If your flight is with the relatively newer fleet, then you might take a risk, but I wouldn't advise that, as Singapore and Asiana were cheaper that time, but I decided to take a risk and got the 773.

I didn't mind, but seeing the fathers carrying the strollers and the mothers carrying the crying kids, and seeing the people having problems taking stairs, I thought it would have been easier to relocate the plane instead of relocate 250+ passengers. Once on board, apparently, things got delayed and the flight crew was pushing people to move quickly instead of helping passengers. The food was ok, not special, but they totally skewed up the vegetarian options. My seat was broken and extremely uncomfortable.

"""noticed quite a deterioration in quality""",3,T Saunders,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been flying Thai Airways for the past 20+ years and I have noticed quite a deterioration in quality and service levels especially to Asian and India routes. Ticket prices have increased markedly over the years and possibly now much higher than other carriers on the same routes. A Bengaluru to Bangkok return in business class is about THB40,000 (US$ 1250) which is exorbitant for a 3.5 hour flight. For this price, there is no Jetbridge services and passengers need to walk down stairs and bundle into a crowded bus that takes a very long time to reach the arrivals gate. The aircraft put into service is a bit old and worn. My main grouse is the price. I checked out a BKK-HKG flight recently and price on TG was about THB12500 while Cathay was THB8,000.

"""not worth the money""",1,H Terry,"✅ Trip Verified | Munich to Osaka via Bangkok. Avoid B747 Business Class where ever you can! First: it is a mystery to me how you can waste such a lot of space for such an uncomfortable seat. It is not angled lie flat or even flat at all. I wouldn’t care about an angle, but these seats are too short (I'm 1,86m) and have several angles, so at maximum you can lay back somehow, and the footrest isn’t stable, so whenever you move (even in turbulence) it will sort of “swing”. Secondly: service shows much effort but little result. For instance: There are attendants all over the cabin, but if you need any kind of refill (wine, coffee, water) you have to go to the galley and ask for it. Thirdly: the Lounge at BKK: completely overcrowded, had to wait for an hour to take a shower (which was a mould lover’s paradise), and don’t even think of the famous spa, if your transit time is below 5hrs. In a nutshell: outdated product, inefficient service, poor lounges, not worth the money. On their 747s I would not even call it a Business Class. A good premium eco will be a much better product and deal.",Boeing 747-400,Business,Business Class,Munich to Osaka via Bangkok,November 2017,no,1,2,3,1,1,0,1
"""the service was very poor""",2,M Anderson,"✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I decided to fly Thai Airways as we had flown with them a number of years before and had a good experience. On this occasion there were a few issues. The first leg from London Heathrow to Bangkok was excellent, flew an A380, great flight. The second leg from Bangkok to Sydney was on a clapped out 747, the flight itself was mediocre but the service was very poor. The major problem was on the last leg from Bangkok to London Heathrow, we were supposed to fly an A380 but apparently the plane was ""broken"", however, it seems the plane had been unavailable for at least 7-10 days prior without a replacement A380 being found. After a delayed take-off, which again appears to have been the case for more than a week, we shuddered home on a 777, must be the noisiest plane I have flown on in 40 years. I booked a long-haul flight on an A380 as I am very tall and the leg-room is usually good and the comfort is usually excellent. Not so the 777, my knees were in constant contact with the chair in front for a 12 hour flight. If I book an A380, I expect to fly one just like if I book a Mercedes I don't expect a Ford!

"""really impressed""",10,Simon Sasai,"✅ Verified Review | I went back to visit my family in Thailand and got a one way ticket back to London with Thai Airways. I have been warned by many Thai friends that I would not receive a good service on this airline plus Thai Airways is always the most expensive. I decided to book because I wanted to experience 'the service' and I have hadn't flew with them for long time (my last flight with Thai Airways was in 2007, I was a little kid could not remember anything). I got a one way ticket for 25250 THB about = 580 GBP for one way. On the day I flew, I was almost the last one entering the airplane since I was enjoying my shopping time at BKK duty free but the air crew still welcomed me with a smiley face. Since I was one of the last onboard, I did not have space in over head cabin to put my carry on bags. The purser assisted very nicely. He took my bag to put in somewhere in the back and told me that he will take it back to me once the plane departed. He took another one to his room and suggested I do not put valuable items in either bag until I get it back. After the first meal (I did not eat much because I was not hungry, it was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning in Thailand). I was asleep for long time and once I got up another staff member asked if I was hungry or want anything else like a sandwich or something. It was totally different to what I have heard from other people so I did not expect this much better service to happen to me. The seat was new and comfortable.

Cabin crew was on hand to welcome passengers on board and were present throughout the cabins during boarding. The cabin was clean and bright. It was nice having seats of 2 to 3 different colours randomly scattered throughout the economy cabin making it vibrant. The cabin crew first came round with a packet of snacks followed by a drinks service and then a meal service. 2 options are available for the main meal. I opted for the curry snapper which was good.

Flying on the A350 was a great experience: Cabin extremely quiet, comfortable seats and very large IFE seatback screens. Excellent range of latest release movies and tv shows. Reclining the seat causes the seat to slide forward, which slightly reduces legroom. Personally I like this, as it means reclining doesn't trouble the person behind. Meals were ok, though not wonderful. The child meal we booked for our daughter (for both sectors) was delivered on the MXP-BKK sector but wasn't loaded on the BKK-MEL sector. Cabin crew on the A350 or at least the one crew member looking after our seat (33A-C) didn't smile once in the 10+ hours on board. She was quite abrupt at times during meal service, which is disappointing and very uncharacteristic for Thai crew. The crew on the second sector were much nicer. Friendly and professional at all times. TG 461 BKK-MEL was a 777. Noisier than the A350 with smaller IFE screens which had much less clarity. The 777 seats are comfortable, though the legroom wasn't as good as the A350. Again, the food was ok though not as good as Thai flights a couple of years ago.

Downside is you are bused to international side of airport and then walk up a stairway to the jetty vs relocating the airplane to the domestic side, stairs are little challenging if old. I opt for these vs narrow body ThaiSmile or other airlines as there is generally a lot of priority to ensure they are on-time within a small buffer zone of 20 minutes. Seats are good, 9 across in 777 versus the spacing saving in most carriers is evident. Service is rushed given the time, but coffee and small chicken snack. IFE was old but reasonable. Cabin crew are rapid paced which is fantastic, I'd love to see if they have same energy on international legs.

You should then think if you are in business class you would be in a business class bus. No - the sign on the bus says so, but the bus does not leave until completely packed. One word - cost savings over passenger comfort. If you make the effort to ask the Thai call center you will get a list of excuses from it is the control tower to the weather.

The Boeing 777-200 on the first leg was old but OK, the front economy cabin on the A380 on the second leg was curtained off from the rest of the aircraft and was a very quiet and comfortable area - not surprising given that this area is used by some airlines for first class. Food and service on both flights were very good (given that it's Y class after all) and the baggage allowance generous (40kg for me as a silver status Royal Orchid Program flyer). However, being offered almost identical two breakfasts on the same day (one on the inbound aircraft and one on the outbound aircraft five hours later) wasn't a great experience - at least I had a choice of main dish so could vary it slightly. The international transfer arrangements in BKK are a disgrace - the airport is really letting the airline down. I arrived in BKK on TG 462 at 6am and departed TG672 at 8.25am. I joined the transfer queue at around 6.20am and only got through security at around 7.25. A lot of the time was spent held back at a gate where desperate pax with tight connections were coming forward and begging to be allowed through but told by unsympathetic officials to go back into the queue. I had sufficient time to make my onward flight but the whole process was stressful and I think that BKK airport's bureaucratic incompetence really undermines a lot of the good work done by TG staff on long haul flights.

Comfortable seat, two window-side storage bins, plenty of space between the seat and the window to put your shoes and other stuff. What I like of the A380 seat is that you can slide the tray with your full dinner on it and easily move out of your seat. I am used to high quality service and excellent food in Royal Silk, but this time the service highly exceeded any previous experience. Excellent flight overall. If I only had any - very minor - complaints it would be that, after 5 years in service, the monitors seem to have a lower resolution than more modern aircraft (or probably it's only my impression, as my inbound flight was on a super modern A350 where the monitor quality was impeccable), also, the restrooms, even in Royal Silk, feel quite small comparing to Thai's A350 or B747. Also about the restrooms, I was happy to find that the moisture lotion has gone back to the excellent Bulgari Eau Parfumée au Thé (Blanc now, it used to be Vert a few years ago), after switching to Era's Cloud Nine for a while. The only pity is that the lady in front of me stole the whole bottle after less than 15 minutes into the flight. Despite these little details, a great flight experience! One final note: check-in, as always at CDG, was a nightmare. But it wouldn't be fair to give a bad evaluation to Thai's ground staff for that, as it was handled by CDG's staff.

Meal was a choice of chicken curry or fish. I had the chicken curry and it was delicious with rice and crunchy beans. My partner had the fish and he said it was delicious. Soft drinks wine and spirits were offered with the meal service. The wine was ok after one glass decided to stay with ginger ale. Service was professional and smiles all round. Throughout the flight they offered water and juice, later in the flight they offered mango ice blocks, yummy. Toilets were kept clean and fresh, they are good sized toilet on this aircraft 787.

Had more Champagne after takeoff with a funny bit of chicken first, followed by a Thai northern sausage, which was hot, but I did not like the cooked egg dish or nuts. The caviar is now served in a controlled portion screw top bottle with plated garnitures and vodka has to be requested. I chose a Thai selection for main course which was extensive. Duck in red curry was not very succulent as I don't think that reheating duck can turn out very well, unless as Confit. Dried shrimp was fiercely hot. Long cooked soft pork was soft. I did not need anything else but the cheese looked nothing special. Red wine was an improvement on anything offered in Thai that I have ever had. Sleeping was not so good. Seat length and width are good. But the seat is hard and segmented, the seat cover and blanket are of poor quality and they could purchase United Polaris pillows rather than the uncomfortable two currently on offer.

So he cannot put me on the flight unless he gets response from them. He said my visa isn't real and there is something wrong with my passport, that's why there's no feedback.

To my surprise Thai Airways have now increased the upgrade cost by around 30 - 35% and is now very poor value and not recommended for anyone that may be considering it. The aircraft was an elderly 747-400 which was showing it's age. The business class seats (upstairs) were angled lie flat, very worn with faded upholstery. These are the same business seats Thai have used for close on 15 years and are way past their use by date. Considering they are flying Boeing 787's to Brisbane and the new A350 to Melbourne I cannot see why we still have this worn out 747 on Thai's most important Australian market, Sydney. The food service has improved slightly from what I can remember with the food now plated by the flight attendants before serving however they still insist on a totally French wine list where most other airlines offer some Australian or NZ wines on the route. The inflight entertainment is pretty poor with limited choices compared to competitor airlines. The screen size and clarity is also poor due to the age of the system.

Their ground staffs have been informed by TPE check in counter that there were 4 passengers on TG 635 (TPE-BKK) will miss the connecting flight (TG910) from BKK to LHR, because the first sector flight from TPE delayed for 1.5 hours. But no one in BKK airport anticipated this by booking the hotel for the passengers. When we arrived at BKK airport, the customer service said they had not booked the hotel room and airport hotel was fully booked. We were asked to wait at the counter for almost 3 hours while the staff disappeared (helping another passenger with the visa). It is midnight and everybody was very tired, but who cares. We were just sent to airlines lounge at 3am to wait for the hotel room which was just ready at 5am. We ended up staying at BKK airport for 13 hours.

"""it's amazing cabin crew""",9,SeungJune Chang,"✅ Verified Review |  Seoul Incheon  to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi via Hong Kong.  Thai Airways offered much better service compared to my previous journey. The counter was big enough to take all of the passengers swiftly. However, the problem occurred after half of the check-in counter closed, in order to take Uni Air passengers. Large group of travellers were forced to go around and line up again. It was not understandable how they had 3 special checkin counters where few people used (Crew only, Internet checkin, and Business class/SA Gold card holders), and had 2 common economy class checkin counters where everybody used. After the bad start at check-in, we had to run in order to make it to the gate, as Incheon was crowded at that time. Onboard, the cabin looked very clean and new. The seat width felt little bit small for me with heavy lady seating alongside me, but seat pitch was acceptable; it felt same with other airlines in my seat. I moved my seat for the second leg of the flight, as there was an empty seat. I moved to a window side seat, and the seat width felt very nice to me. However,  there is a metal box under the seat in front of you, which restricted me to stretch out both legs (which was possible in some degrees in my previous seat).  Cabin staff service, I couldn't find flaw in their service. They were willing to help, and cared about passenger safety. They were there to help passengers to put up their carry on items to overhead bins, which must have been hard for them, as the flight was almost full. I am impressed with cabin crew service. In this flight, I never knew that I could stuff in 2 meals in such short time period (6:30 hours?). Their food quantity was just right, and food quality was nice. However, in both of my flight, as a passenger seating in front side cabin, I was forced to choose the meal that I did not want. Once, when I asked cabin crew if they have another meal that I could eat, they brought me business-class food for me, which was obviously very pleasing, and nice of them.  I would love to give TG 5 star rating on food, but I can't, as some meal options was unavailable. IFE was quite nice; it takes a little bit of time to get used to, but once you get used to it, it will work dandily. I really liked how they had traveling information about big cities such as Bangkok, Seoul, Tokyo, and more. But their variety of Music/Movie/TV Shows could be improved in the future. Wi-Fi was available, but it was paid service.

I thank the ground staff in Chennai (MAA) for giving me priority baggage tag for my ""gold"" Star Alliance membership status. Well, but they weren't supposed to; Asiana Club gold is equivalent to Star Alliance silver status! Also, when they were asked to put our seat together, which they told us that it is possible to do so before, they did it for us; but there was an aisle separating both of us. Boeing 77-200 uses 3-3-3 layout, and their seat width was very nice, but seat pitch felt very cramped with an IFE box under one of my foot, making me fly the whole 3:30 hr flight with my right leg folded. Food was tasty though, and flight attendants weren't bad. They were smiling, and was willing to help, but the part where they just watched at the passengers getting up shortly after landing (When seatbelt sign was on) was pretty disappointing. A330-300 was better because I could actually go to sleep. After landing at HKG, we was asked to deplane and get on a another A330, and ground crew messed up again. One TG ground crew at the gate told us to go to certain gate. We found that there was no plane at all! We then asked another ground crew (Who was working for HKG airport this time,) She told me to walk about 6 minutes to get to our plane. We had to rush to catch up to our plane, and HKG ground staff was correct. A330 to HKG to ICN felt the same. In this flight, I tried using Wi-Fi, hoping for any free internet usage, but it was paid service. Personally, their IFE was terrible for me.  Despite the negatives, I saw lots of positives on this flight though. Cabin crews were very nice to me and my family, and were always there to help me. IFE's hardware of A333 was pretty impressive, or actually better than SQ's one, since TG's IFE offered touch screen!  Food was very nice; one of the most delicious plane food I've ever eaten.

The boarding on to the plane was one of the best in my opinion. In the plane the seat offered enough legroom and as soon as I settled in to my seat the crew offered me champagne along with nuts and she also hang my jacket. There was a basic and functional amenity kit, together with a cozy blanket and pillow. After takeoff food was offered, but it was a bit disappointing. The crew forgot my wine for dinner and a coffee at breakfast, at breakfast they gave me the wrong option, don't know if they forgot or not, or they ran out of the other option.  After landing the deboarding was a bit of a mess, since all economy passengers ran in to Business. I would recommend to close the curtain while deboarding, so that this cannot happen.

"""cabin interiors seemed a little bit tired and worn out""",8,Joel Knibbe,"✅ Verified Review |  This was my first time travelling with Thai Airways flying Incheon to Melbourne. All flights were on-time or nearly on-time and the cabin service on all sectors was of a high standard, but there is room for improvement in other areas. The cabin interiors seemed a little bit tired and worn out, especially on the 777, with the seat upholster being damaged and screens out of date and not working properly. I ordered a gluten-free (GF) meal but regretted the choice, as they seemed to have also removed almost everything else from the meal in the process, only giving me a bland piece of chicken with tasteless steamed vegetables. The normal meal looked much nicer and was incidentally GF anyway (rice and Thai curry). I cancelled the GF meal for the return journey and just substituted their bread with my own GF bread. It also seems a little strange and annoying that Thailand's flag carrier does not have adequate gate access at Bangkok airport, and so all of the flights involved bussing to and from the planes, which were parked very far away. Upon arrival in Melbourne I noticed that my bag had been opened and the zips broken. I lodged a complaint at the Melbourne luggage desk and after following it up just once, they ended up sending me a brand new suitcase in time for my return journey. I was quite satisfied with this response to my complaint. Even though I had a dis-functional screen on one sector, I was mostly satisfied with the entertainment overall system. The only other issue was the seat comfort. I really think this could be improved, as there was an entertainment system processing box under the seat of the 777 and the seats on the A330 felt like I was always sliding off them. Overall it was a decent product for the price, but they could especially improve on seat and cabin quality.

I booked from Thai Airways website, and because the amount was over 10M rupiah, I had to come into the sales office in Jakarta to pay in person. Because my transit time was 18 hours, I received transport and accommodation in Bangkok, but even that I had to request and no details were given on the transportation procedures. At the Indra Regent hotel they didnt provide breakfast, despite Thai Airways saying that breakfast was on their account. When I asked Thai Airways to clarify this with the hotel, they said it's on the hotel. The entertainment system/screens were very old and dated, resolution wasn't good. The headphones jack didn't work on one side, and the magazine pocket wasn't fixed properly so the magazines kept on falling. After the meal service, picking up the trays took very long, and on one of the flights I had to call the attendants to pick mine up because they skipped me. Attendants weren't friendly. To have a blanket I needed to ask, not on every seat. Checking in at Dubai was the worst. Line was so long. Local staff had no customer service skills.

She slept near 10 hours on what was bump free journey landing back ahead of time into Zaventem something never achieved with Brussels Airlines, United Airlines or British Airways night flights. This was my first Thai Airways experience but after flying with big American and European carriers this was something special with their 777-300ER out and back and with one leg of four flights on the one month old A350.

Upon arrival at Bangkok, I went to the Royal Orchid Spa for my free massage, it was very good. The only downside is that it was only 30 minutes, you should add more ground services for business class passengers. Next, was the Royal Silk Lounge, it was average, buffet food. It was disappointing to be honest, I expected more from an international business class lounge. In flight, the cabin crew was friendly and helpful.

It was in marked contrast to the dozens I have taken over the past 30 years. The flight was 7 hours late and we were put up in the BKK Transit Hotel, this was fine although the hotel is pretty humble. The lounge prior to boarding in the A concourse was looking scuffed and it was crowded, food was not great but coffee and fruit were fine. Delays at the gate as well but so far was still in reasonable spirits. The A380 seats aren't the best but at east all offer aisle access. In the air the meals were reversed with breakfast first given the delay this was now a day flight instead of a night one. Crew were unresponsive and glum looking. Breakfast was very overcooked, had to ask for everything including missing cutlery. Two cracked and chipped glasses offered, one badly cracked showed lack of care and any inspection. They were genuinely apologetic when this was pointed out but this was a rare show of passenger focus. Did not see crew at all during the majority of the flight for any period of time between meals, water was replenished once. Dinner was not heated at all and asked for it to be reheated as it was inedible. No pre-dinner drinks, offered one drink with dinner, never saw any offer of any top ups in cabin to any other passengers. Not offered water with dinner. Drinks were replenished on request. In general I felt that you had to ask for everything, there was no anticipation of passenger need. We wanted the flight to be over as quickly as possible, an unusual response to business class.

Yet remarkably, although the airline reached us easily via email and had all our contact numbers upon our initial purchase, no one from the airline contacted us when the flight from BKK to LPQ was discontinued. When we checked in at the airport in Phnom Penh for the first leg of our trip (TG 581), and we asked for boarding passes through to LPQ, both the check-in agent and her manager simply shrugged and said they were ""not available.” Arriving into BKK and looking for the now-disappeared TG 576, we were grateful to be handled by an admirably competent Transfer Desk Agent who spent half an hour rebooking us onto a later Bangkok Airways flight. She was the only bright light in an otherwise poor Thai Airways experience. We arrived late into LPG and poorer for having overspent on tickets with an airline that wasn't concerned about honoring them by keeping us informed.

Attentive crew doing drink rounds every half hour, and a comfortable (enough) flight. Much above expectations. However, my mum's bag arrived when the business class bags arrived, but my bag arrived almost twenty minutes later! Still, doesn't bother me that much.

The connection time in Bangkok was only scheduled to be 1 hour which made the connection tight and tighter with the delay. Upon arriving in Bangkok there was a line up for transit security however it moved along fairly well. Because of the delay I boarded with everyone else and that was no a problem for me. As I was seated one of the flight attendants was clearly not amused or friendly that I had not been seated before. That Thai friendliness and welcome was not there. A few minutes later as we were taxing for take off the youngest of the flight attendants in business aggressively and rudely barged in to the space in front of my seat and grabbed pillows and rudely announced that they were going in the overhead bin. I have never experienced such rudeness from one of the Thai flight attendants before. This same flight attendant repeated her performance prior to landing in Seoul. I coupled that with the lack of welcome and friendliness upon being seated and it was not the greatest of experiences with Thai this time on that flight. If they were not pleased with the tight connection and my inability to be earlier to my seat, then they should take that up with their airline and not blame me. As for the other flight attendant with the rudeness, she needs to be more familiar with appropriate etiquette.

I reached the airport a bit early and the First class check in counters were not open as apparently they open up only after the lounge opens at 5.10 am. Anyway the staff were nice and check in was done in the First class area while the staff offered us cold towels and water. You have a separate area for security and immigration for premium passengers and we were taken to our lounge on a buggy! The lounge staff greeted us in typical Thai hospitality and offered a selection of breakfast items from an i-pad menu. We also had one hour free usage of spa services which was excellent. the flight was slightly delayed and the pilot kept us informed. However the inflight service was very disappointing for First Class. A very limited menu for a 6 hour flight and they ran out of choices very soon. Something which should not happen in First really. Crew were ever so gracious but that does not serve it purpose really. Seats are comfortable and the amenity bag was very good. Toilet was spacious and well maintained and they offered free WiFi cards for usage of 20 mb.

As an aviation enthusiast, the A380 includes a tail camera and Thai lets passengers watch this camera on their own screen.  The seats and cabin was very clean, all the items where in the seat pouch along with the Thai magazine. I  reclined my seat and stayed asleep from the edge of Thailand till we entered Russian airspace. This meant that the cabin crew did not wake or disturb anyone, and the seats were very comfortable. The IFE movies were an OK selection. The IFE map was also standard. The food on the way to Thailand was tasty, I had chicken with fried rice, it was excellent! I tried a fruit platter on the way home and the fruit was a little dry however, but the croissant made up for it. Overall, I would really recommend Thai airways (especially on A380 routes) for long haul flights. I am yet to try the short haul with Thai.

"""professionalism of the crew""",8,Brian Fisher,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Bangkok return. Having used most Gulf based airlines when flying to and from South East Asia over the past three years, accepting the inevitable transfer time-wait until the next leg, I thought it was time to experience a change. So, for my recent flight from London to Bangkok, I booked with Thai Airways which now operates the A380 – and of course, flies non-stop. Travel to Heathrow by road from my home in Mid Essex, is always a bit of a gamble with regards to allowing sufficient time to arrive. The now ubiquitous delays on the M25 have to be allowed for, which I did on this occasion and reached Terminal 2 just before 0800hrs, for my scheduled departure at 11.50hrs. To my disappointment and surprise when presenting myself at the check-in desk, was being told that the flight would not now depart until around 15.30hrs. 'Late coming in from Bangkok', was the reason. That I had not ben informed of this long delay, was irritating, as my personal contact details were available to them. Putting all this behind me (but not looking forward to waiting around the airport for almost 8 hours) I spent the time as constructively as possible, particularly sending notifications to the Bangkok car airport transfer company, the hotel I'd reserved and the company with whom I had an appointment the following morning. Once on board, it was immediately apparent that the cabin crew were well trained, polite and helpful. The A380 aircraft is a big beast and the internal configuration design is appealing. Long haul flights like this one exceeding 11 hours, are never easy to bear but I have to say that Thai Airways have provided all possible features and amenities to soften this burden. My seat was as good as it gets, the entertainment system worked perfectly with plenty of choice - and all meals served to a good standard. Noticeably, a press of the seat call button produced an immediate appearance of a member of the cabin crew, an occurrence not always experienced when flying with some airlines. The plane actually made up a little time, which meant arrival at Bangkok was three hours behind schedule. So, as to the flight itself, I have no complaints, rather to compliment the professionalism of the crew for making it as comfortable as possible. With my Asian itinerary completed, it was time to return to the UK. On arrival at the Thai Airways desk, I was extremely pleased to be offered a space available cabin upgrade. The return journey is always some hour+ longer than the outward leg, so lounging on a wide seat, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar-covered biscuits, is not to be sneezed at. Such an upgrade was especially welcome, as I had suffered an injury to my left ankle. Once again, I found the crew's performance to be as first class as the cabin and after eating, I extended my seat, snuggled under a blanket and slept for almost six hours. In summary, both flights were seamless and comfortable. They get a ten out of ten from me.

No wine was offered on this flight or on our outward leg, so perhaps an economy drive is in situ. Breakfast menu was shown and requested the Thai omelette and a cup of coffee - the coffee came and when clearing cup I was asked if I would like another. I declined, another coffee came but no breakfast! Was not in the best of moods so bit my tongue but did mention it to cabin crew member who stated that she was the purser - who then said sorry! Have since related this to Thai Airways but not holding my breath as still waiting for a response, other than an automated one from customer relations for an email sent on 19/02/2016.

The service was interrupted twice by turbulence. This delayed the service by 60 minutes at least and you could tell the crew were getting tetchy as they tried to make up for lost time (ie. crew rest time) as they literally threw the desserts and coffee at me. Food was poor quality for a J class experience. The wine selection was also very basic.

Check-in was efficient as both ways had a separate seated check-in area with a lot of counters. No queue at all. Had business class tickets, but after boarding we were upgraded to 1st class. Online you can't book 1st class for this short flight, so I suspect they cherry pick from business class and fill 1st class (instead of just leaving 1st class totally empty as some airlines do). Seats are located in the nose of the ground floor of this 747 in a 1-2-1 setup (though as it narrows down to the front it becomes 1-1-1 and the 1st row is 1-1). Seats are not new but comfortable nonetheless. Wide from seat to feet. TV screen is of good size and has a good video selection. Also for my 11 year old daughter. Didn't really liked the TV remote, though it did bring back good memories from the 90's. Food was not 1st class but business class food instead. This is understandable as all  were upgraded from business class. The kids ignored the food served but the chocolates with the meal were well received. Choice and flow of drinks and tidbits were endless. Staff was super nice and attentive. Every few minutes they'll come by and offer their services, till having said ""no thanks"" a few times and they'll leave you alone. Boarding of this fully booked 747 (it was just before the King's birthday) was orderly and quick. The Singapore lounge was disappointing. They have their own lounge but it's small and has not much to eat. It doesn't have it's own toilet, so you'll have to walk out (not far) and use a public toilet. The Bangkok lounge was better. Large and good choice of drinks (available at the bar, just outside the actual lounge, but can consider in lounge area). Free 30 minute massage at an actual spa was an extra bonus.

But the catering is a disappointment. With only a total of five pax in first, my first choice of meal was unavailable as only three were loaded. The second choice (or pork) was so overcooked I didn't eat it. The serve-yourself food selection in the lounge was just some nuts.

They advised me to contact our airfare agent to get the refund, which I thought at the time was a ""buck pass"".

If they are serious about turning around this airline they should look at improving service to fare paying premium passengers, not the opposite. Costs can be reduced by for example dealing with ridiculous overmanning at ground staff level. The plane and seating were excellent. The staff did their best and were apologetic about this failure to provide an appropriate level of service to premium passengers.

"""overall the flight was good """,5,Gary Marsh,Bangkok to London Heathrow with Thai Airways. Flight departed around 45 minutes late. The cabin crew were welcoming and friendly although their chatter behind the curtains of the kitchen area were quite bothersome when we were trying to sleep. The cabin crew who looked after our section was superb and very attentive making you feel really quite special. The cabin temperature was just right throughout the flight. The food selection was particularly disappointing with a very poor selection of food available. There was no main meal but a selection of snacks and breakfast for the 12 hour flight. Totally inadequate especially if you have been travelling to reach the airport since the morning. That said I felt the crew were also embarrassed by the measly offerings. The cabin was well staffed and there were plenty of crew around to help. They all seemed to be quite happy and content making the passengers feel valued customers. The seats were 180 degree lie flat beds which I found a little cramped around the foot area. The configuration is 1-2-1 on the upper deck although there are around 60 passengers so it does not feel so personalised. Entertainment was the same as the outward flight and the same as offered in October. The screens were responsive to the handset and again it was great to watch the plane land and take off by camera set on the rear of the plane. Wifi is available at a supplement so we never bothered with it. The seat was relatively comfortable although I felt uncomfortable at times especially when sat up trying to read. It was a bit alarming to find that a passenger had boarded the plane with a ticket stub stating a wrong flight number and wrong seat configuration although it turned out it was the correct flight but the seat number was completely wrong.  I wondered why this had not been picked up on the two screening areas before he reached the aircraft.  While overall the flight was good I would go as far as saying that was due to the crew rather than facilities and standards provided to its passengers.

Previously the standard of catering was above average with delicious tasting dishes but there is a major cut back in the food presented. I would go as far as saying it was dire. Entertainment the same films on offer in November as October. Not very interesting selection of films to be honest although I had no problems using the handset to choose what I wanted to watch.

The first passenger service agent I talked to seemed clueless when I requested to obtain my boarding pass. He referred me to his colleague who was more eager to serve. Business class passenger services was terrible in Paris CDG Airport. There were two Business counters open but only one line, therefore the passengers who arrived later formed a second line to correspond to the number of counters and therefore skipped 2 parties (myself included) who were in line ahead of them. This is unacceptable as the ground staff were ignorant of the inappropriate manners of the other passengers. When it was my turn to the counter, I simply requested them to print out the boarding pass as I already checked in online, but the agent (who is actually an Air France agent but was serving for THAI) said I had to wait until she can get a Thai Airways agent to check my credit card. This took over 20 minutes and I was stuck at the counter until the other agent arrived. Big thumbs down. The lounge facility was average as CDG is not a Star Alliance Hub, but the staff were very friendly. Boarding was not the best and very chaotic.

"""lounges at Bangkok were utterly tragic""",5,James Macky,"My Thai Airways flight from Auckland to Bangkok was not as I was expecting after reading some reviews. The Boeing 777 was newly refurbished, clean and on time. The staff were friendly, professional, served the food well and kept the lavatories immaculate. (Great toilets on this plane, about twice the size on many other planes.). But some things were odd. My main course for dinner - a curry, was an economy meal, still in its little aliminium tray, but sitting on the Business Class China. Dessert was an ice cream in a tub, or a chocolate bar. The electronic entertainment is old, murky image and very poor for anyone used to the digital clarity on Emirates and others. And the seat - well, it's impossible to get comfortable in any reclining position in this seat. How it ever went into production I'll never know. The lounges at Bangkok were utterly tragic - as others have written. In the small lounge that has the showers, the three toilet stalls in the men's room were totally blocked! So ugly! In the others, all totally crowded, we all wandered about looking for somewhere to perch. The food is very poor quality.

"""Thai hospitality always ensures a pleasant flight""",10,A Wong,"Flew Melbourne to Bangkok with Thai Airways on the overnight flight on a Boeing 200, aircraft slightly showing it's age but the service as always was of a very high standard. Cabin crew gave out hot towels as soon as the plane reached cruising altitude and throughout the entire flight never faltered with their professionalism and providing a service reminiscent of the famous Thai hospitality. First drink round before dinner, then another drinks round after dinner had been handed out. Food was excellent for economy class, with a tasty pork curry served and a breakfast of chicken with noodles or a Western breakfast served prior to landing. Good range of entertainment options too. Despite the older aircraft seats were comfortable and I was able to get some sleep. Toilets kept very clean for the entire flight. On arrival in Bangkok we were taken to airport by shuttle buses. Was very surprised to see a new looking Boeing 300-ER used for the return flight from Bangkok to Melbourne. Seats were even extremely comfortable with good padding, and the larger entertainment screens and modern bathrooms made for an even more pleasant flight. Staff were as always very hospitable and friendly, and always willing to answer questions and to bring around drinks after the lights had been turned off. I have flown with Thai many times and not once have I had a bad experience.

In my 2 last flights to and from Brussel my seats were not the cleanest.  On last flight most blankets had an awful smell.  Each time I got my priority luggage out first, except fishing rod tubes (still within 158cm 3 sizes limit!) arriving at the end, and for my last flight it is still missing. For some long hauls the trips to or from planes are by bus. The Boeing 787 seem more noisy and in business, the configuration does not offer much space for shoulders and feet.

No excuses or explanation from staff. Upon our enquiry we were just told ""We are tired, too."" Entertainment program was not turned on - of course - during the waiting time. Even with a brand new A380, the computer had to be started over and over again until it finally worked. This does not inspire confidence into the board computer for the pilots.

I've been flying TG since the 1990s and while some of the same business class seats from that time are still being used (and these sorely need replacing), the high level of service in the forward cabin from that time is no longer seen. During a 3.5 hour flight at the prime dinner hour, the crew rushed through service of a three-course meal so that all was done 75 minutes into the flight - and then lights out and the crew could retire to sleeping or talking. Food was just so-so. Gone are the days of the fruit and cheese cart - in fact gone is cheese entirely. Dessert is a sad cube of supposed cheesecake and some fruit tart, both on a small plate covered in plastic wrapping (giving it a hospital cafeteria feel).

When it comes to service and resource management they still haven't quite got it right. At PKT check-in, they decided that each counter would have it's own queue. That confuses me since they were for the same flight and this split queue system is known to make wait times very inconsistent. Ground crew seemed very shy, and were not keen on speaking to us, or at least they were so quiet we couldn't hear them, and the same was observed for the cabin crew, who also seemed somewhat distant. Their IFE looks like it's 10 years old, and is due tor an update, despite the system being touchscreen.

I thought this was a very nice gesture and am very thankful for it. The rest of the ground and cabin crew from Thai were also very professional, kind and helpful. The seat was comfortable and thanks to the kind ground stewardess I had all the leg room I needed. Food and drinks were good and tasty. I liked the coconut dessert and the fact that on a short flight there was another round of drinks after the meal.

Finally, it took 46 hours in total to reach Amsterdam (includes delay, overnight stay, flights in transit) from Auckland. Better communication to stranded passengers would have resulted in an ideal outcome as we were unsure as to how long we would be stranded in Bangkok and the location of our luggage.

He disappeared and never came back. Finally after the meal we got someone to come and they forced the seat to recline but it never worked properly. The seats are nowhere near lie-flat and are quite uncomfortable. There was a limited range of movies and hardly any TV programmes. How hard is to offer a decent range of entertainment? The food was mediocre and seemed the same as you get in Economy. The breakfast was terrible – a hard, fully cooked egg that was called poached on a tough muffin. We were never offered the bread basket. The steward walked straight past us. We had the same disinterested service on our next flight on a 777-300. The food was a bit better but not great. There were no snacks offered overnight. The staff seemed more interested in serving dinner quickly so they could spend the rest of the flight resting and chatting. And seats were even worse.

For the price they are charging for a business class ticket one would think they could provide some decent wines and video entertainment. Seats are not flatbed and were not long enough for my 180 cm frame. The business class lounge was very poor although not operated by Thai they should not be using 3rd party operators that provide poor food and drink selection and no in site rest rooms.

Thai Airways customer review,8,S Hopkins,Reading some previous reviews and as a very nervous flyer - I was quite worried about flying with Thai Airways. I can honestly say however that I had a brilliant experience flying with them and in most aspects I wouldn't set it apart from the likes of Emirates or Ethiad. The staff were friendly and helpful - even putting up with those annoying kind of passengers who keep wondering up to the kitchen etc. The plane was clean and kept so throughout the journey. Inflight entertainment was great the same as I would expect from Ethiad/ Emirates - plenty of new releases etc. The flight was smooth and enjoyable. Would fly with them again.,None,None,None,None,None,None,4,4,4,4,0,0,4
Thai Airways customer review,9,Alan Petten,BKK-DEN April 2014. 777-300 was spacious. Suvarnabhumi airport is nice until you get to the boarding areas they feel like they are still not finished and airport has been open for almost 10 years. Food and service were good lounge was nice and thankfully had decent showers which were nice after an overnight flight to BKK. Took advantage of the massage service in their spa very nice.,None,None,None,None,None,None,5,5,5,4,0,0,4
