So in the main lounge of Delta I asked a ticketing agent if they could reroute us through JFK. I knew that since we were already involuntary rerouters, our ticket status would allow that. The agent said he could, then asked a supervisor who only saw trouble and problems, then said: sorry no seats on the flight to JFK. I just like to make a point that ticketing agents should not lie to  customers. Delta's systems are so transparent that such lies wont hold. I did not persist but when I left the lounge for my flight to Amsterdam the JFK flight was boarding and the flatscreen said it had 20 open seats and that only 89 out of 117 had checked in which meant 48 open seats.

Just about made the connection. Overall not bad on the eastbound legs. Food outstanding out of ATL. Good service, a little stand off-ish, but generally good. Arrived LHR 40 mins early. No Line at fast track and bags already on carousel so overall a good experience. LHR-BHM wasn't quite so smooth. Food terrible & this is not an understatement. I had baked cod that was described as crispy, but in fact was chewy and slightly rancid, so I didn't eat it. As I usually find eating in a plane more of a diversion than anything else I was happy to pass on the food. My son chose basil tortellini but bizarrely came in a cream green curry sauce. Not sure what the were thinking when they came up with this menu. Not nearly as good as Eastboud USA origination. My wife had the oxtail that she said was really nice, so I guess my son and I just made poor choices. Service (apart from 1 FA) could only be described as frosty. Landed ATL 20 mins early. Security a breeze. Now the fun begins. I picked up a text from DL to inform me connection was delayed by 45 mins, no big deal here, but as it was last flight out on Xmas eve and seeing the lines for rebooking I was starting to get a bad feeling. Then the flight delayed another hour. The heart starts to pound a little more, then 15 mins before boarding and it gets cancelled. Was then given 2 options 9.55pm on Xmas day or 6.10, but couldn't accommodate all 3 of us so we would have to choose who was in which flight. Really! Delta sucks when it comes to these type of occurrences. Yes, the delay was weather related and was mostly out of their control, but to have no reasonable back up plan is poor. They had already cancelled one of the earlier ATL-BHM flights, so surely could have anticipated this a little better. In the end I managed to get a car from Avis and drive myself, so all was not lost. If I had taken Delta's option I'd no doubt be feeling a little like Tom Hanks in the 'traveller'!

They want you to put carry-on items under the seats, but the seats are so close that it is very difficult to get them out again. The aisles are so narrow that even really skinny people hit other travelers when they walk down the aisles. The final part of our trip was delayed because the previous flight was late getting there. One of the flight crew kept trying to speed up the boarding process. He yelled at people not to block the aisles, and to let others around them.

I spent 30 mins on phone to Delta arranging his ticket, was given a seat assignment etc etc. The next day when checking in my son had a seat request boarding pass, so checked in with gate agent and was given 12A for my son and 1D for me. I told them he had been assigned a seat next to me in row 1. They checked computer etc and said that was impossible as the PAX in that seat had purchased in October. I asked if that PAX had been awarded an upgrade and if so as I had a paid 1st class would they be able to downgrade a non paid 1st class. I was then told they couldn't do that. So as the plane is boarding I call their prem Skymiles number and explained. I was told by them that they never oversell in 1st class and should have downgraded someone, probably even had a couple of non-revs in that cabin.

Across the isle, an elderly woman who clearly doesn't speak English motioned for service, unable to clearly get the message across, the woman pointed towards the snacks on the cart the FA was pushing, then the FA grabbed a bunch of snack peanut packets, and literally threw them at the elderly woman.

There we were told that we'd be dropped off at our plane that was ""waiting"" and no worries about our connecting flights in Amsterdam. There was no plane waiting in Pisa. We were dropped off with no direction in the Pisa airport parking lot, we had to go back through security and stand in lines trying to figure out which flight we were suppose to take.

They would tell us to get in a specific line, where'd we'd wait for over an hour, then they tell us to go to a different part of the airport and get in a different line. The connecting flights that were missed for some reason could not be rebooked at the airport and we were told we had to call Delta ourselves and reschedule. To which, after two attempts at 1.5 hours each spent on hold I was finally able to rebook my flight at an international calling rate of $2 an hour, so I spent over $400 just to rebook the flight.

So 2 weeks later, I get back and make a call. Somehow it says that I flew the flight. Every person I called said that they couldn't do anything and gave me another number to call or sent me to the airport.

But then there is too much fuel on the plane, as it was meant to be a transatlantic flight. So have to remove some fuel in order to fly to MKE. An hour later, why have we not moved and why has air conditioning on the plane been turned off? They can’t figure out how to remove the excess fuel and turned off air conditioning to facilitate the removal but forgot to turn it back on!

"""so uncomfortable and claustrophobic""",2015-09-07,8,Alek Perovic,"There have been a lot of negative comments of Delta Air Lines business Elite seats and I initially thought of them as being overly critical, until I had a first hand experience on my recent flight from JFK to Moscow. The seats are narrow, but so are many other airlines. What I liked was the configuration with single seats in a zigzag pattern on either side of the plane giving privacy to single travelers. Not much storage space, though. It's the tunnel like part of the pod where one's legs go in when the seat is in full flat position. The space is so confined that it's impossible to keep the feet straight up, forcing a person to lie on one's back only, unable to bend knees, requiring a contortionist skills to attempt sleeping on the side. The feeling is actually of being forced into a very narrow coffin. I honestly could never imagine being so uncomfortable and claustrophobic on a plane. I wonder if anyone at Delta actually tested the seats before installing them, certainly would fire those responsible for the decision!

Not a difficult question I thought. So the FA goes back to the galley (I could see it all happen from my seat), opens a foil tray and comes back to my seat with one word - carrots! Talk about taking care of the customers. Eventually when my food arrived, sauce had been spilled all over and somehow under the tray. Not sure if this was intentional or not, but needless to say I didn't eat it!

The bad: old planes, hard seats in business, small AVOD screens, dirty toilets, captains constantly using toilets in business class so passengers are blocked, mediocre food. On top of this, baggage snafu in ATL caused my travel partner and I to miss our connection on the way to RDU and they would not put us on the next available flight until I threw a fit. That's customer service in the US. You have to behave badly to be treated well. I'm considering the hot Japanese carriers on my next trip where I know the food and seats are superior.

Because I was picking up a dog on the way back, I couldn't pick up my boarding pass electronically. The lines for help were long and the electronic rejection gave no answer. I tried to get help from 3 different Delta personnel, these were women who were recounting their evenings the night before and had no desire and felt no need to interrupt their gossip with work. Finally I found a friendly face among in the Delta line-up and this woman helped. The air crew was surly. Didn't think it was their job to help put up a bag. Turned up her little nose when my son asked for a drink. Atlanta to Savannah they held us on the tarmac 2 hours. Horrible. The way back was even worse. They were nice enough in Valdosta - which is so tiny they sort of have to be - nevertheless they body-searched an 80 year old woman in security. As usual the plane was delayed at Atlanta. Here there was no help available once you got there. Surly personnel. As a Amex Platinum card carrier, I was told I had the right to use the Delta Lounge. Since I was carrying a puppy and had my boys, we went to the lounge. The rude pretentiousness was shocking, and they refused to let us in the lounge.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-08-02,10,M Tonelli,"I flew with Delta from Chicago O'hare to Pisa via Detroit and Amsterdam. Between the big three American airlines (United, AA, and Delta), Delta would be my favorite. On all the flights they were organized, fast and on-time. From Chicago to Detroit, which was flown on a crj900, lasted only an hour but they still handed out snacks and drinks. On that flight my family and I were put in Comfort+ for no extra charge. Comfort+ had very nice legroom and very good seat width. The long haul flight from Detroit to Amsterdam was flown with a 767-400, which is in my opinion the nicest plane that Delta flies. With a 2-3-2 layout and me traveling in a party of 3 made it so we traveled in the middle section and were still undisturbed by an extra person next to us. It made the entire flight feel a whole lot more private. The IFE systems were great and had plenty of movies to watch. Were left on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This made it super easy to catch my connection. At Amsterdam we had plenty of time to relax and explore the airport. We had to fly with Transavia, one of the low-cost carriers linked with KLM, and that was slightly chaotic in boarding but comfortable inflight. We arrived on time and I'm impressed with the quality of Delta. ",CRJ900 / Boeing 767-400ER / Boeing 737-800,Family Leisure,Economy Class,ORD to PSA via DTW and AMS,June 2015,yes,5,5,5,5,5,5,5

The Delta Hub in Atlanta said they would send a plane, then after 3 hours of waiting, the pilot received word that it had not even taken off.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-07-31,1,Sharon Doyle,"We arrived at JFK, checked in and promptly went through to the departure lounge. Bought our Duty/Tax free shopping, to be told we couldn't purchase it from that particular shop as we needed to go to a different terminal via bus.
After a fiasco trying to find the lounge (building works going on and no clear notices), we'd walked the full length of the terminal to find our lounge had no Tim Horton's. Well it did, but it was in the domestic flight section, separated by a rope and we weren't allowed to duck under to get coffee so had to go all the way back to the far end of the terminal to get a coffee from Starbucks. That done, we went to find Duty/Tax free shop. When we asked a member of staff where the Duty free shop was, she smirked at us and said there wasn't one. Had I known this I'd have made my purchases prior to my flight to the States. Then we boarded our flight. The seats were ancient and everywhere appeared dirty. I'm 5'1 but was squashed into my seat which was lumpy and not comfortable at all. Dinner smelt like a cheap microwave meal and looked very unappealing. The staff weren't particularly helpful.

SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCN–ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights.

Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-07-21,3,Rosemary Westgarth,"We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with.

Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra £50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video.

It was nice to check bags with no fees! Boarding was efficient in AUS and it was a nice touch to be addressed by name. Boarding efficient and flight left on time. It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-07-09,9,Juan Eukel,"The terminal in SEA was unbelievably chaotic as it was a mix of overseas, Hawaii and cross country flights. There was very little seating and the place was cramped. Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant.

The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that lay flat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It compromised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag.

We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have layflat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that layflat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight even though some of it was across the Pacific Ocean. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. Flight safety is serious business. A safety briefing by a cabin attendant reinforces that. Downplay it with a cartoon gives the impression that its all one big joke. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It comprised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40 min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class.

The Levo wraps and frozen yoghurt bars on the two transcontinental flights were 100 times better than the coach dinner and lunch served on the two international segments. Appreciated the open bar on all four flights but not the wine from a box on JFK-KEF. The cabin crews were friendly and professional on all four flights and there was no wait for luggage in either KEF or LAX.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-05-20,0,C Wallace,A simple flight from BWI to NYC turned into a 3 hour wait on flight 3371. With very little communication between the staff/pilot and the passengers. On a bright sunny day in MD and only mild rain and overcast in NYC the pilot said it was weather related. After waiting for the plane to arrive for 2.5 hours. When we get on the flight we had to wait another 30 minutes on the plane for more ridiculous reasons - they claim the baggage door was not shut properly. So someone comes to shut it and then we go out to runway. Then we have to wait another 13 minutes. Not able to rebook me for reasons that were also very vague. The flight was overpriced and didn't event accomplish it's intended purpose to get people where they need to be on time. As a business traveller this is absolutely unacceptable.

The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds.

Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago.

Hot towels were handed out at the beginning and end of the service while two meals were served during the 11-hour flight. If we required more drinks or food the staff were more than happy to oblige.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-04-14,2,W Rongu,I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that.,None,None,Business Class,None,None,no,2,2,2,3,0,0,2
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-04-14,0,David Kaiser,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away.

A lot of other airlines have more than just small bowls of whatever they're serving. (At least there were showers). NRT-SIN was normal and like the previous flight.

The food and wine are excellent as usual and the IFE is industry leading. Let me not forget to praise the huge monitor for the IFE. Much larger than other airline's. Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy.

They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-03-19,0,Melissa Carson,I will never book with them again. I am currently stranded in Seattle with my 3 children who I had booked to fly as unaccompanied minors. We called to book their flights and were assured that everything was in order. After a 5 hour drive to the airport today we were told that they could not go on their flight because it was the last flight of the day out of their connecting city. Even after calling twice to confirm everything before we left! We were offered nothing more than an insincere apology. It's like they didn't even care. What pathetic customer service.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-03-17,0,R Irwin,"Flew DC to Albuquerque with connection through Atlanta. Arrived in Atlanta followed display boards for departing gate. Got to the gate 90 minutes before departure confirmed gate location was correct and sat down. Sat 10' from the counter the whole time and looked out the window. Thought it was strange the plane hadn't arrived yet and they hadn't made any announcements. Gate Agents were busy issuing Delta Dollars to a bunch of passengers from last flight so the area was very busy. Turned around and happened to see on the reader board along the wall (not behind the gate) that there was a gate change. No announcement was ever made in that terminal that the gate had changed and there was no announcement with out names to go to the gate. It was moved from B28 to B3 literally as far apart as you could get from each other. By the time we got to B3 the door had closed. We found a ""red coat"" employee across the hall. She made it seem like we were idiots and there would have been announcements made. She put us on Stand By from Atlanta to Salt Lake City we had 3 shots to get on one of the flights. However it is spring break and Salt Lake is a huge destination point all flights were oversold and had 30+ people on standby for each flight. In the hustle to get from one location to the other and going to 3 different terminals we saw numerous reader boards that indicated gate changes and while sitting in those 3 different terminals we never heard one announcement for any gate change on a Delta flight. We finally had to buy tickets on Southwest so we could get home. While sitting in their terminal we heard announcements for gate changes over and over and they were paging passengers to check in at the gate.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-03-09,0,A Stanton,"This is my first experience flying with Delta and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was canceled over 20 hours in advance and I was automatically reassigned to a flight departing 13 hours later. While I appreciate a seat at some point their were 6 flights earlier that I could have been placed on and I was not given a choice. I called Delta and had an associate inform me that I was ""not a priority"" because other flights before mine had been canceled. She also told me my departure weather was the issue she was incorrect. She did absolutely nothing to help me on the phone and was unapologetic. My co-workers on other airlines all departed mostly on time and make it to the same destination I was heading just fine while Delta continued to tell me the weather was not ok. I arrived at the airport at 5am and proceeded to sit in standby flight after flight. As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-03-09,0,E Berman,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,no,3,1,2,3,0,0,4

Solid 757-300 economy plus to Las Vegas. Solid crew everything was nice and smooth. The 757 had been refurbished had a great AVOD system. Flights on time crew very friendly.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-03-04,0,M D Sperry,In early August 2014 I booked a Business Elite ticket from STT to ATL for February 22 2015. My confirmation indicated my seat number and that a meal was included in my ticket. At check-in however I found that Delta had changed my status to Economy with a seat far back in the aircraft. When I called Delta to rectify the situation I and my Son-in-law were both treated rudely. We spent 2 hours on the phone with the result being that I should “ request to be upgraded at the airport. At the airport there was another 30 minute wait before I could talk to a Delta representative only to learn that I'd have to appeal at the boarding desk. A one hour wait ensued at the head of the line at the departure desk while the Delta representative ignored me waited on other people and fiddled with a computer terminal that wasn't working. The end result was the same rudeness and no help at all. I got neither the meal nor the priority baggage check-in that I had paid for. The flight was late arriving in ATL and I had to run to make my connecting flight to BOS. Delta had changed my seat assignment on this flight also. When I called to file a complaint the Delta Supervisor informed me that Delta changes aircraft seat assignments and passenger status without notifying passengers and confirmed that they had sold my assigned seats to more than one person and that these were normal”practices for Delta. I can't imagine why anyone would want to fly with Delta Airlines. Once they have your money they treat you like dirt or worse. There are plenty of other carriers out there. Based on this experience I can't see myself ever flying Delta again.

Tiny overhead movie screens. I thought Delta had all seat back video screens. I would have been really annoyed had I spent the money to sit in First - those seats were not so much better than Econ Comfort and the same tiny overhead movie screens every few rows.

Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall.

I didn't get economy comfort on DFW-ATL but paid $19 for a preferred seat I think it was not a good idea since got group 2 and almost didn't get space for my carry-on because group 1 passengers almost got it all.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-02-11,6,Gerasenkov Andrey,LGA-BNA operated by Endeavour Air on Jan 30th. Aircraft - 2 week old CRJ900. Departed 2 hours late due to the plane arriving late and the crew attempting (unsuccessfully) to fix a broken overhead bin lock. Eventually they gave up and scotch-taped the bin cover so it wouldn't open during the flight. Otherwise the flight was uneventful and fairly comfortable. Snacks and soft drinks were distributed and the FA's were attentive. My return flight from BNA got cancelled due to LGA completely shutting down due to the winter storm on Feb 2nd so I got rerouted to JFK via ATL. The 40-minute flight from BNA to ATL was uneventful and was on a completely full 23.5 y.o. A320. No food or drink service on this short flight. The ATL-JFK eventually departed 3 hours late despite most other JFK-bound domestic flight cancelled. The MD88 was completely full which was understandable given that the three previous flights to JFK were cancelled that day. Despite its age the aircraft was comfortable and the flight smooth. Upon landing in JFK we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the taxiway for a gate to become available.

When I got to my gate the flight crew was already there and chatting with travellers. Boarding was quick. Unfortunately there was a slight delay due to 'mechanical failure' but I still arrived on time. FA were excellent with 3 drink services (I think) and offering coffee and water in-between.

When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA. The JFK-BDA flight was also very pleasant although I slept on that one also.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-23,8,N Stepp,Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-19,9,N Hartmann,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated.

It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay. This might have been a one off situation. I usually have found Delta friendly and helpful as the agent was who helped me to get on my flight.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,yes,5,5,5,5,0,0,5
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-14,1,J Barach,Horrible experience all around. The priority level ticket agent was not able to find the ticket for our lap child wasting 45 minutes of our time at check-in. When it was finally found on their system they were not able to print it for us. Just very frustrating and stressful. The business class on Delta is laughable. Lets see drop down screens from the ceiling no different than they had in the 1980s. The movie didn't even work on the return flight. Food quality I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Its pretty bad when you buy a business class ticket and you don't even get a movie on a 5.5 hour flight or a decent meal.,None,None,Business Class,None,None,no,3,4,1,1,0,0,3
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-14,0,M Bachalo,"My daughter and I traveled from Winnipeg to Basel recently. Our return flight from Paris to Minneapolis was delayed and therefore we had to rush to our connecting flight. Little did we know how far apart the terminals were. Delta staff should have informed us of the distance and offered a passenger trolley. It turned out that as we arrived at our departure gate the information board said ""Boarding"" however the Delta staff person would not let us board. While we waited at least 10 minutes for a supervisor we watched the information change from ""Boarding"" to ""Closed"" and we watched our plane depart without us (along with another passenger in our circumstances). We were booked on another flight seven hours later meal vouchers were denied as we waited the seven hours we saw instances (more than one) where other passengers were allowed to board after the ""Closed"" sign was on. Delta staff were not prepared to assist us in any way nor did they appear to be trained in customer service. This is just one issue albeit the biggest one that we had with Delta personnel giving incorrect information being rude (not the FA - this was all with the staff at the various airports we dealt with). The FA's were wonderful on all flights - perhaps Delta would best be served if they did the training to the airport staff.",None,None,Economy Class,None,None,no,1,1,4,4,0,0,1
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-14,1,Kyle Slick,"As a frequent traveler I feel I've coped pretty well with the US Airline ""nickel and dime"" mentality that's resulted in baggage fees exorbitant ticket change fees and the dwindling supply base fare economy class seats (not to mention the dwindling leg room in those seats). Now Delta does not allow seat selection with economy class fares. My company do not allow class upgrades which means I'll forever be the really tall guy stuck in a middle bulkhead seat if I fly Delta. Old planes with no power no in-flight entertainment (it never fails to amaze me how many ancient CRT televisions are still mounted to the roof of Delta cabins). On longer flights Delta refuses to stock enough food to meet the demand of passengers towards the back of the plane. Sure I can survive a 6 hour flight with nothing but peanuts and pretzels but why? The only positive thing I can say about Delta is to give a kudos to the majority of attendants that are willing to put up with grouchy passengers and restrictive rules. The ones that maintain a positive attitude deserve an award.",None,None,Economy Class,None,None,no,1,3,2,1,0,0,1
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-14,3,S Soleiman,Took the trouble to order kosher and vegetarian meals for my party of 4 only to find that the kosher meal comprised an apple and 2 bananas and the vegetarian meal was some cut melon - Delta seem to have lost all creativity when it comes to meals? To make matters worse since half the flight must have ordered the same special meal none of which was opened or eaten by any passenger the flight crew then proceeded to open each sealed package and throw out the fruit so that they could retrieve their special cheap Delta plates for later use. I personally witnessed at least 20 such meals being discarded. I regret having had to use Delta on this trip after having managed to avoid it for so many years.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,no,3,1,1,3,0,0,1
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-14,9,M Leong,JFK-NRT-SIN. Lounge at JFK was nice the flight was long and seats were narrow. The food could be improved but then again the catering was from JFK so my expectations weren't high. Crew were fine and overall the flight was good. Wish I used the showers in the NRT lounge as I was in for a longer wait than expected. Departure was pushed back an hour and we waited another hour and a half on the ground due to traffic. The staff handled the delay well and the wait was more comfortable than expected. Landed in SIN at 3am as a result. Still good experience overall.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,yes,4,5,3,5,0,0,5
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-11,7,N McFadden,Flew Comfort Economy YYC-HKG return. Booked flight 6 months in advance (and got a great deal) but over the next four months our flight itinerary was changed six times. Since some of the changes impacted our flight by over an hour I called to change to other flights - agents were happy to help out and they answer their phones promptly - a pleasant change compared to the waits we usually experience with our regular airline Air Canada. Alerted by email of all but one of the changes which I noticed by accident. We had paid extra for Comfort Economy and one of the changes meant that the fee for Comfort Economy was higher - instead of notifying us that we needed to pay an extra $20 to keep our Comfort Economy seats they just put us in a regular Economy seat and kept the $130 we'd paid to begin with! Thank goodness I noticed. Flights themselves were good. The extra leg room on the long haul flight was wonderful. Wide selection of entertainment. Plenty of food/drink offered and quality not bad (daytime hot meals ok mid flight snack fine breakfast awful). Service attentive. Very cheerful on the way there and pleasant on the return flight. Connecting flights from Calgary-Seattle were on old planes but fine for a one hour flight - staff were great. I would fly Delta again.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,yes,4,5,3,5,0,0,5
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-11,9,Alex Coias,LHR-JFK return. I tend to pick Delta due to the affordability and nice service. Again I was not disappointed. Flight going out of London on time and plane not full. Got plenty of space and the food was good. Coming back to London the flight was packed and the plane was slight older however the food and service was good. I asked for a special meal that was accommodated on both flights!

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-05,8,H Christmas,My flight with Delta was a short 1 hour trip from LAX to SFO. It was unfortunately delayed due to bad weather but the service on the flight definitely made up for this. Drinks peanuts and pretzels were offered soon after departing LAX and a healthy snack box filled with trail mix wholegrain crackers guacamole tomatoes celery and carrots was also provided. I did not expect this to be included in the price at all on such a short flight! After flying with another airline on a domestic US trip the service on Delta definitely stood out and I would definitely fly with them again.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,yes,5,5,5,0,0,0,5

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-05,6,G de Domingo,PDX-AMS-PDX: Flew on economy comfort for both legs. The PDX-AMS was good with the typical Delta service which has improved over the years. Aircraft was clean and a very good IFE. For the return flight it was quite different starting with a very disorganized Delta security at the gate. The contracted agent were borderline rude and did not have a clue what they were doing. During the flight the cabin crew appeared to do a minimal job and could care less about the service and especially the state of sanitary conditions of the restrooms. Delta management should work on improving the consistency of their crew.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,yes,3,3,3,5,0,0,3
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-05,4,A Bastien,TPA to LAX on 12-10-14 B737 Economy Comfort another routine Delta Flight. Uncomfortable seats with slightly more legroom than economy but with minimum recline. I give Delta low ratings on account of the uncomfortable seats. Otherwise it's pretty much like other U.S. carriers. Food for purchase. I didn't buy any so rated it at one star. Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-05,6,G Dedomingo,PDX-AMS-PDX. I was seated in economy plus for the both legs and this is definitely more pleasurable than the basic economy. However the seat cushion still remain hard and quite uncomfortable for a 10 hours flight. Food was okay and very good entertainment system. The crew was professional and attentive on the PDX-AMS. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the return flight was borderline lazy doing the minimum and spending more time socializing on the back of the aircraft than paying attention to the passenger and especially the cleanliness of the bathrooms.,None,None,Economy Class,None,None,yes,3,3,4,5,0,0,3

Seats are great - I'm tall and they do the trick. VOD system is outdated and flight tracker rarely works. The return flight was about an hour late and the crew was much better. Food from JNB was much better than first flight. I would rate the second crew as outstanding.

Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-05,10,S Baker,We flew Delta Airlines 777 business class from LAX to Bangkok (via Narita) in October 2014. The seating configuration is one of the best we have seen internationally. The lie flat seats were enhanced with two pillows and a comforter. The second/smaller pillow worked very well for your legs/knees over the long flight. The comforter was the most enjoyable blanket we have ever experienced on an international trip. It's amazing that such a small difference in quality can make such a large difference in the sleeping comfort and environment. The only complaint about the seat configuration is that it is difficult to communicate with a traveling partner.,None,None,Business Class,None,None,yes,5,5,4,5,0,0,5
Delta Air Lines customer review,2015-01-05,5,A Bastien,OKC to ATL then ATL to TPA MD 80 from OKC to ATL then twin engined wide body Boeing from ATL to TPA. Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline.,None,None,Premium Economy,None,None,no,1,4,1,1,0,0,3
